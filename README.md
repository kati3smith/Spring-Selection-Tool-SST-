# Spring-Selection-Tool-SST-
Spring Selection Tool (SST) for the FloWave Ocean Energy Research Facility

The **Spring Selection Tool (SST)** is designed to assist in selecting appropriate spring configurations to represent the scaled elasticity of fibre mooring lines in tank testing of offshore renewable energy (ORE) devices. By automating the search through extensive spring catalogues, the SST helps users quickly identify arrangements that match target stiffness values while balancing practical considerations such as availability, procurement, and ease of installation.

Full instructions and information may be found in the supporting documents attatched:

- README and Startup Guide : An overview of the purpose, design and technical specification of the Spring Selection Tool (SST). Also provides a startup guide.

For more detailed overview of the backgorund and motivation, please refer to K. Smith (2025) *Synthetic fibre mooring systems for offshore renewables: Bridging the gap between tank testing and numerical modelling*.
