# Spring-Selection-Tool-SST-
Spring Selection Tool (SST) for the FloWave Ocean Energy Research Facility

The Spring Selection Tool (SST) is designed to assist in selecting appropriate spring configurations to represent the scaled elasticity of fibre mooring lines in tank testing of offshore renewable energy (ORE) devices. By automating the search through extensive spring catalogues, the SST helps users quickly identify arrangements that match target stiffness values while balancing practical considerations such as availability, procurement, and ease of installation.
